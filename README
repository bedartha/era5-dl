Downloads daily data from CDS for S2S analysis (as per FuXi S2S)
================================================================

The total number of layers are 76, of which 11 layers are for single-layer
variables, and the remaining 65 layers are from 13 pressure levels with 5
variables at each layer. The resolution of the data is 0.25 degrees but will
be regridded to 1.5 degrees for the S2S training. The detailed list of the
variables are given below.
